This is an ingredients markdown for converting pure text to arrays of Ingredient objects. 

EXAMPLES
==========

the following syntax will create a tc object with your tc markup in "Ingredient" form;

tc = TableCloth.new "1 cup of sugar"
puts tc.ingredients.first

All of the following will parse to an equivalent object;

"2lbs Potatoes"
"2 lbs Potatoes"
"2 lb Potatoes"
"2lb Potatoes"

The following will also be parsed;

"1 tablespoon of sugar"
"1 bouquet garni"
"a cup of sugar"
"salt to taste"

Eventually you'll be able to do this;

tc.to_html
